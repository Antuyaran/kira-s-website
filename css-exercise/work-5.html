        To prohibit means not to allow, to restrict and to oppose. The history of prohibition is the history of human development. As long as people of different status or position existed, the word "prohibition" appeared in the world. At the root of this, prohibitions are usually a warning to ordinary people by an authority or researcher about the management of a geographical location, a thing or a behaviour, and most of these prohibitions lead to more serious consequences or harsher fines, sometimes even life-threatening. For this reason, prohibition statements in public places are often concise and serious in tone, often giving the public a sense of majesty, restriction and being warned. Prohibited signs are a highly distinctive part of the Chinese urban landscape, regulating the behaviour of citizens and shaping the spiritual character of the city. Orange barricades with 'No Parking' and 'No Passing' signs can be found everywhere in the streets and alleys, while public places have 'No Smoking' and 'No Pets' signs.
