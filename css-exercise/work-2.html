    <p>
        The Breaking Music Festival is an outdoor electronic music festival project designed for NetEase electronic music brand called Fever.
    <br>The venue of the music festival is Lusheng Square in Qianhu MIAO Village, Guizhou Province. We take the ancient legend ‚ÄòMother Butterfly‚Äô of MIAO as an entry point, trying to seek the connection between electronic music and traditional culture. By combining the silver jewelry in MIAO costumes and the visualization of envelope line, we complete our concept and visual content.
    <br>Breaking, is the theme of this project. Using the story of ‚ÄòMother Butterfly‚Äô, we summarize the birth of human life into two stages: physical incubation and spiritual breaking. Breaking is a subjective consciousness that wants to break through the status quo and gain new life, and music can often inspire the self buried deep in the heart. We hope that the listeners who participate in the Breaking Electronic Music Festival can use music as a path to break through the difficulties in life and complete the spiritual breaking.
    <br>The whole visual system of this project includes dynamic posters, human-computer interaction, holographic projection, virtual jewelry, handmade jewelry, videos, Augmented Reality, etc. We try to convey the concept of the Breaking Music Festival from multiple aspects and angles, and present the audience with different sensory enjoyments in various visual forms.
