        PINK DRUG is a fun font for my favorate band called Placebo.With its heavy font size and rectangular outline, this font has a strong impact as a headline font, and is also recognizable. However, due to its heavy font size, a lighter or white fill color would be preferable, so I wanted this font to be designed for a rock band that is both powerful and feminine.
